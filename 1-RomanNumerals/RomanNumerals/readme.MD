## Overview

This is a very naive implementation of the Roman Numerals kata.

The implementation converts an integer to its Roman numeral. Some examples:

-    1: I
-    3: III
-    5: V
-    15: XV
-    49: XLIX
-    1995: MCMXCV

## Your Task

Try to use the basic method of "remove duplication, improve names" through stepwise refactoring to convert this design into a simpler one that better reflect's The Four Rules of Simple Design. 

The implementation provides tests so that after each change you make you can check whether the change broke any functionality - an important component of refactoring is a suite of tests that ensures you are not introducing bugs while improving the code.
